 Imagine you are writing an app that will display a fun fortune (i.e. something like "You will soon find what you seek.") based on cards drawn.

 How many values can playing cards have? How many values can `Int` be? It would be safer to have an enum for the card's value as well. Inside the struct above, create an enum for `Value`.

Initialize two `Card` objects and print a statement for each that details the card's value and suit.
